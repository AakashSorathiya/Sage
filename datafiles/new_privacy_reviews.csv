1,"Don??t bait people in to take their information and sell it and add them to your mailing list then force a paywall to use the app. Free to download pay to use, 1 star no recommendation due to lack of transparency.",6/4/2021 5:28,calm,apple
1,"Installed and uninstalled a million times. When I contacted tech support they just advised me to uninstall, reinstall again. The option to join a support group sounds promising, until you join and find out there are only two, and the one I joined was moderated by by a therapist who couldn??t facilitate any kind of cohesive conversation. Not that it was entirely her fault since it was just one giant streaming text thread, no subjects or organization whatsoever. 

They say you can video message your therapist, but the maximum video length is 5 minutes, so if you??re right in the middle of a delicate explanation and time runs out, you??re interrupted. For me, that was distracting enough to end the train of thought I was on and remind me that I was on a digital platform, not a personal safe space. I can??t share my intimate feelings that way. 

You don??t get to choose your own therapist. You are assigned one. That is a terrible system. A really terrible impersonal system. 
The idea behind Talkspace is a good one. 

There are just too many shortcomings for it to work the way they describe. I hope they figure out the tech, hire better therapists, and overall improve the current clunky experience. What they offer is definitely not worth what they??re charging.",11/1/2018 15:43,talkspace,apple

2,"I'm downgrading my review to one star. This app is advertising in a misleading way. If anyone needs help in determining whether or not spend money on this service, read my review.  This is what the app IS: A place where you can vent. If you don't have journal at home or a journal-like space on your computer and you would prefer if that journal occasionally talked back, this is for you. If you feel like you can't talk to friends/family about something in your life, this is for you. It's an app for lonely people to feel less alone. It's a place to air your thoughts. It's a place where someone will ""listen"" to you and tell you sympathetic things. (Examples: had a breakup, pet died, moved to a new city, fighting with a roommate, don't like your school or teachers, considering a career change)  This is what the app is NOT: a place where you can find comprehensive, in depth therapy for serious/legitimate mental issues and pressing life concerns. If you are really struggling and you need to work with someone because there are problems that are consuming your life. DO NOT BE TEMPTED BY THE FACT THAT YOU CAN ACCESS THIS ""THERAPY"" FROM ANYWHERE INCLUDING HOME; PUSH YOURSELF TO SEE A *PSYCHOLOGIST* OR A *PSYCHIATRIST* IN PERSON! A lot of the responses will be taken straight out of a textbook. If you are having a really hard time this WILL NOT HELP YOU.   (Examples: depression, dealing with the death if a loved one, self-esteem issues, anger issues, bi-polar disorder, suicidal thoughts, phobias, divorce, addiction, etc.)  My experience is that this appears to be a part time job for the therapist/counselor. You're a second thought despite the price. I tend to hate leaving my house so I thought this app was for me. Considering the severity of my symptoms, filling out charts and being sent photocopied suggestions was not what was going to help.   I think we really, truly need to reassess what we consider to be counseling and what we consider to be therapy before applying that label to various services.

1,"Very unhappy.

I signed up for this month with the maximum plan and paid for the four live sessions that go with it. I hadn??t used the sessions and decided that I should change my subscription for NEXT month to the middle tier subscription with only one live session so that I didn??t forget and stay on the same plan for next month. 

When I did that, it charged me ANOTHER full month and took away my 4 live sessions for this month that I already paid for. I contacted you guys and Instead of fully refunding me, you charged me an extra $58 and then....credited it to me for next month? I would like my money REFUNDED please-doesn??t everyone?, as right now I??m not sure I want to continue on this app for a myriad of reasons. 

There have been so many issues with the app this month, both for my therapist and I-have had messages and voice messages get deleted or not send, I get thrown off the app constantly when I type up an essay of important thoughts and then lose it, AND it??s been making it impossible for me to schedule a live session with my therapist making the ease of use for this app go out the window completely and be replaced with utter frustration. 

Yesterday we tried doing the FIRST Skype live session one of this month and it failed in two ways-it showed to her that I had ZERO live sessions left (when I should have 4) so she didn??t get paid, and THEN while I was mid sentence and crying and going into a heavy topic, the app started freezing and my therapist and I were kicked off and she wasn??t even able to send me a voice message after and I was left in a really bad state that exacerbated my mental health. 

I??m EXTREMELY unhappy and I love my therapist but your app/interface/contact system is making me want to leave ASAP, but the fact that I haven??t gotten/can??t get what I ALREADY paid for is what??s making me most irate. This isn??t ok. You advertise that I can always get in touch, but I??ve had nothing but problems for almost 2 weeks. What??s going on? This is a blatant joke and for the amount of money I??m paying and the fact this is a MENTAL health service, you??d think you??d want to have a useable interface that isn??t bugged with issues, allow customers and therapists to communicate, not overcharge people, and actually refund instead of crediting because I don??t know if I want to stay with you guys!

1,"A good concept but a disappointing experience.

First, it is very misleading when it says 24/7 chat. Some sort of chat therapy would be a really great thing to have, but that is not talkspace. They should openly say that you will only get one message a day from your provider 5 days a week. This is not what I expected.

The first week is all just about setting up your therapy, and with one message a day and multiple forms to get through, this goes at a snail's pace. It feels as though the therapist are trained to drag out the set up period for as long as possible. So the first week is essentially wasted, but you are still charged for it.

 The other thing which seems unethical about this app is it constantly threatens you that you'll lose your therapist and never be able to pick them again. I feel that if this were a legitimate mental health app and you could not afford a therapist for a couple of months that you should be able to get back your old therapist no matter how much time has gone by. Your issues are personal and therapy is meant to build on your relationship with a therapist.  

*Edit* To their credit the support team did refund me which I am very grateful for. 

I found my therapist online which seemed like he had his own practice, but when I messaged him saying that the Talkspace format was not going to work out for me and that I wanted regular therapy sessions, he said he was sorry and that he could only offer therapy through Talkspace. 

This was just my experience with one therapist but it makes me question the credibility of the therapists on talkspace, I'm just not sure if they are real or not. Either way, one text a day just wasn't going to work for me. :(",7/19/2020 22:09,talkspace,apple

1,"This app has portrayed itself as providing you with extremely accessible help, which is attractive for someone with a difficult schedule. In practice however, you cannot even schedule a time to chat with your therapist without getting confirmation from them, which for me has only occurred 24 hours after a message. Additionally, there is no proactivity on the side of the therapist to follow up and schedule a time that works for you. 
TalkSpace customer service states that some therapists simply like to keep the schedule in the hands of the customer, which seems like an excuse for getting paid to do absolutely nothing especially with the delays in scheduling an appointment in the first place. For someone who is going through a difficult time mentally, you know that there are ups and downs. I got this app when I was able to seek some help under the impression that someone would be immediately available or at least be a bit responsive. Instead, I now have the financial stress of having to pay over $200/month for the past three months compounding with my underlying issues with no assistance from the customer service team.

And yet talkspace is insisting to me that they did their due diligence because the man still has a license. (His cases were not dropped or revoked, but ""settled"". In their words, ""you can't revoke somebody's license for bad press."")

1,"First I would like to say that I have had amazing experiences with 1-on-1 therapy over the past 10 years, & I truly believe therapy has changed & possibly saved my life.

That said. I was recently in a situation where I was unable to afford in person therapy, so I thought I would try Talkspace. I spent 4 months on this app hoping I would find some support while I was going through some big life changes & serious depression. During this time, I was shuffled between 3 therapists, re-explaining my situation each time.

Over this time, it became clear to me that the therapists that sign up to participate in this app are trained to simply copy & paste random parts of your message & place them after the words ??I heard you say? & send you to-do lists pulled from some database (& could care less what you did with them. If you didn??t like one, they??d be happy to send you another one! God forbid they should actually help you with it). I really felt like I was either talking to a robot, or someone who was just trying to do the minimum to check off ??respond to talkspace messages? in order to receive whatever amount of coins they??re awarded by pressing send.

I really gave this service a chance because I truly wanted (& needed) it to work. Unfortunately it just made me more angry, embarrassed, & depressed. If you are thinking about therapy- please go see someone in person, who is really invested in your wellbeing. Therapists like this really do exist, & you deserve that kind of attention if you really want to overcome your mental struggles.

??Edit:
Yes, I did contact support multiple times throughout my time using this app, & the only ??help? they gave was instructions you could??ve figured out yourself by looking at the website. Oh and also I forgot to mention, your therapist just might decide to go on vacation at any time with barely any notice (happened to me), so suddenly out of nowhere, no matter your emotional state, you??re paying for no service. Sure, you could shift to another therapist, but talkspace should know that it can be traumatic to relive your experiences over & over to new people you??ve just met. SUDDENLY switching therapists is just not simple for a mentally struggling person- in fact it is distressing. Does this developer even know how depression & anxiety work?

2,"The therapy I received was okay, but using an app for treatment wasn??t a good fit for my needs. So when my therapist went on maternity leave and my account was ??frozen,? I figured it was a good time to cancel my subscription. I thought I had successfully done so, until several months later when I was charged nearly two hundred dollars (a larger charge than I used to pay) after my therapist returned from maternity leave. I attempted to contact customer service to refund that money, as I haven??t used their services. Instead of ensuring that it was cancelled, they gave me the runaround, talking about how they could improve my experience , etc, etc, and failed to cancel my subscription AGAIN before I got charged ANOTHER two hundred dollars!

1,"Let??s do some simple math. This app claims to have 401,000 reviews with 90% being 5 star. So let??s assume of the 400k reviews that 350k pay for subscriptions. Let??s then hedge our bets and say that after fees, taxes, the devs keep $40 from every subscription. That adds up to $14,000,000 per year. The claim is that most of the cost is for ??artists? and ??developers? but this doesn??t seem to make sense as very little in the app is original. This app is a scam meant to make its developers as much money as possible.

1,"This app has well deserved great ratings for  ease of use and fun interactive features. It also makes great use of the way modern technology has been used to high-jack our endorphins to cause us to return to certain apps over and over again, which I??ve never been happy about with any other app. Unfortunately after paying for the year long subscription (& not enough attention to the fine print which rendered this non-refundable) I became very unhappy with it within a week. Ironically it was doing the anger series that caused this, as the founder??s philosophy on anger was so disappointing and terrible that, well, it made me furious. Instructing people to ??not engage? with their anger and to essentially contemplate it until it becomes an entirely different feeling altogether is totally in line with the rubbishy spiritual by-pass so many new agers espouse that one wonders how much plutonic rage they??re all sitting on. Very Portlandia. What nonsense! Where was the practical advice to understand that rage is a feeling our psyches present in order for us to see where our boundaries are being trespassed? Where was the instruction to practice empathy for ourselves in the face of the anger so that we could get to the heart of it and speak calmly to our upsets rather than ignore them? It left me with deep distrust of the founder and the app altogether. So I started to poke around the settings and discovered that it??s not enough for the makers of this app to get your subscription fees, they??ve also got cross marketing fees going on and problematic tie-ins with advertisers online with no ability to opt out of it, only redirect it so that you are receiving advertising ??tailored to your interests?. How about no advertising? Because that would be tailored to my interests. This was the final straw for me and, as stated above, I attempted to get a refund and failed. That, of course, made me even more furious, which, whatever the maker of this app thinks, is a truly necessary emotion and motivator because the problems of this world aren??t going to resolve themselves. I logged out and deleted my data and am about to download the competition.",9/10/2018 1:07,headspace,apple

I find this to be very frustrating.  I thought I would delete my account and start over, but as far as I can tell there is not way to delete your account.  So, the app is now having the opposite affect for which it is intended.  Maybe I should just deal with a profile that says I've meditated for 10 hours in one day, but really deleting a session should be possible.

When I first got Calm, it had a handful of features unlocked. A few stories, several music/soundscape options. They were great. The premium options were tempting. I was considering buying the premium service though it was hard to justify it considering the plethora of other services available out there. Was Calm better than alternatives? Arguably, yes. Is it that much better to justify the high cost of admission? That was something I was on the fence about. I was willing to give it more time and see. In the meantime, I sung its praises it to a room full of women during a discussion on self-care, meditation, and stress management. I was a fan.  

Now, however, I find that everything on the app is now locked down and only available with the Premium subscription. I no longer have any options left making it worth the storage space on my phone. Where once the Premium subscription was tempting, it is now just off-putting. Apps that have no usability without subscription are immediately deleted on my phone. I gave Calm a little more time out of loyalty for a product I once loved. I??m not angry. I??m not trying to say that you shouldn??t have a premium service option. I just wish you still had some usability available like you used to. While you are good, there are other options out there for me that won??t cost me $$ every year.

She never even asked what I do for a living or about my family. Nothing! I requested a new therapist (because they already have my whole month's worth of money) and suddenly the app started ""glitching.""

Meditation is millennia old. Blocking access to ensure revenue is the least mindful thing I can think of for a concept these guys simply copied.

They say one week on Talkspace is equal to one 50 minute in person session. I've switched to in person therapy and one week of Talkspace at best might equal 10 minutes of real therapy. I had a therapist who ""checked in"" twice per day and in the beginning were detailed and wrote fairly long responses. Then it changed to a sentence here or there. They don't require the therapists to do anything but write two responses a day no matter how short and meaningless they are. I sent several suggestions to their customer service department and they basically could care less. Really they should have refunded my money but more importantly listened to my suggestions, this app will be a thing of the past in a year or two. My recommendation is go to an in person real therapist or check out any other therapy app. The therapists don't truly care (I tried two different therapists) and the customer service team could care less about anything other than getting your money. In person therapy is WAY better and will help you more in the long run. These guys didn't listen to me and just want your money, if what I'm saying isn't true then why do they charge so much for so little? Require so little from the therapists? How do you spell ripoff?

1,I am a highly sensitive person. I carefully manage what video and audio I ingest and I want to choose when. The updated app forces a video on me as soon as the app is opened. It's so distressing that I rarely use the app anymore. Moving images of any sort are inappropriate in this context *without my consent*. Please make these videos optional. I literally get stressed just clicking the orange app button knowing I have to go through this. I'm annoyed that this app change was made do soon after I payed the annual fee.

1,I was not warned about an annual subscription fee coming up that I was charged for. I proceeded to cancel the annual subscription and thought I was done with the app. But NO. I was charged today for a monthly subscription. How can they automatically change my subscription to monthly after I cancelled the annual subscription? They moved me into a free trial of headspace and then a monthly subscription WITHOUT telling me. The process to cancel a subscription is also unnecessarily difficult. For an app that promotes mental wellness they sure do try to gouge you and create a headache if they don't get their money!,8/17/2020 8:45,headspace,google
