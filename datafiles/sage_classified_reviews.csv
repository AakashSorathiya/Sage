20,1,"This app has well deserved great ratings for  ease of use and fun interactive features. It also makes great use of the way modern technology has been used to high-jack our endorphins to cause us to return to certain apps over and over again, which I??ve never been happy about with any other app. Unfortunately after paying for the year long subscription (& not enough attention to the fine print which rendered this non-refundable) I became very unhappy with it within a week. Ironically it was doing the anger series that caused this, as the founder??s philosophy on anger was so disappointing and terrible that, well, it made me furious. Instructing people to ??not engage? with their anger and to essentially contemplate it until it becomes an entirely different feeling altogether is totally in line with the rubbishy spiritual by-pass so many new agers espouse that one wonders how much plutonic rage they??re all sitting on. Very Portlandia. What nonsense! Where was the practical advice to understand that rage is a feeling our psyches present in order for us to see where our boundaries are being trespassed? Where was the instruction to practice empathy for ourselves in the face of the anger so that we could get to the heart of it and speak calmly to our upsets rather than ignore them? It left me with deep distrust of the founder and the app altogether. So I started to poke around the settings and discovered that it??s not enough for the makers of this app to get your subscription fees, they??ve also got cross marketing fees going on and problematic tie-ins with advertisers online with no ability to opt out of it, only redirect it so that you are receiving advertising ??tailored to your interests?. How about no advertising? Because that would be tailored to my interests. This was the final straw for me and, as stated above, I attempted to get a refund and failed. That, of course, made me even more furious, which, whatever the maker of this app thinks, is a truly necessary emotion and motivator because the problems of this world aren??t going to resolve themselves.

85,1,"I tried TalkSpace after leaving an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship. I had an in-person therapist who helped wonders, but I just couldn??t afford it after my money ran out. I was hoping for an affordable option that could help when the panic attacks hit, and this sounded promising. I was able to choose a woman who specialized in abusive relationships and trauma and was excited at the thought of getting some sort of healing. Did I expect this to be just as great as my in-person therapist? Absolutely not. But I was definitely hoping to continue something, at least, to keep me going. 

I wasn??t able to get her schedule until I chose her and couldn??t go back. That was quite a bummer considering she was only available one day a week for two hours. And her responses to my texts? ??You can do this... Keep going... How does that make you feel?... I know this can be hard, but you??re strong...? It felt like I was scrolling Pinterest quotes for an insane price. She would text me back only once and when I would respond quickly, I wouldn??t hear back until the next week. I didn??t even get her for those two hours. I??m past that problem, now my anxiety-ridden brain is onto something else since a week has gone by. She didn??t offer calls or video chats either.

I understand Talk Space is most likely a side gig for therapists who work full-time in an office, but holy cow. I felt worse coming out of it than going in. Lost my money, lost my time, lost my dignity crying over a phone waiting for a text back to make me feel better. Sound like a familiar scenario?

I try not to blame the therapist for a poor set up, but also, why offer potential life-saving services at two hours a week if they can??t be maintained? Maybe I got the short end of the stick. I only had a month to test it and then I had to pay full price. There was an option to try another therapist, but maybe there should be an option to not have to pay that entire price until you find someone you can connect with? When I had insurance, my EAP offered six free sessions per issue until I found the right person. And when I found her, I stuck with her until my money ran out. I don??t know, I??d like to think people would pay for it and stick with it if it meant saving themselves. 

Maybe offer tiers in pricing depending on what the therapist offers? If they only offer texting, of they offer calls, video calls, two or all three? I felt cheated to be expected to pay so much money for one text a week that never went anywhere. I haven??t checked TalkSpace lately, so I??m not sure if this part has changed.

I signed up for one month unlimited messages and a one time video chat. Anyways moving forward that means if I??m covered for one month it would end till July 27 or 28th of 2018.

I expressed how I felt scammed that she could verify I had not been helped since that day and I had been charged over 200$ each month for two month. It??s not right the way the way they handled my claim. Is this what you guys do to people who are vulnerable and need someone to talk to ? You pay your therapist to talk to walls?

In practice however, you cannot even schedule a time to chat with your therapist without getting confirmation from them, which for me has only occurred 24 hours after a message. Additionally, there is no proactivity on the side of the therapist to follow up and schedule a time that works for you. 
TalkSpace customer service states that some therapists simply like to keep the schedule in the hands of the customer, which seems like an excuse for getting paid to do absolutely nothing especially with the delays in scheduling an appointment in the first place. For someone who is going through a difficult time mentally, you know that there are ups and downs. I got this app when I was able to seek some help under the impression that someone would be immediately available or at least be a bit responsive.

140,1,Like many of the other low reviews on here I signed up for Shine a year ago and then cancelled before the next billing cycle. A few days ago I just got charged the $53.99 for a yearly subscription. I have already contacted my bank to dispute the charge. I emailed Shine customer service and also the ??vip? email they are telling others to contact on here and nothing. I spoke with a rep from Apple who looked at my banking statement and App purchase history. Somehow the subscription was through Apple but Shine has collected payment info on their own as my recent charge from them was billed directly from the Shine office. Super sketchy! Apple takes these things very seriously and is looking into it so I would get my act together if I was this app,4/30/2020 19:16,shine,apple,maybe-privacy,yes
141,1,"I love this app. I downloaded it almost a year ago in order to help me sleep better and that is exactly what it did. The calming background music to the simple sleep stories that I was able to listen to during my free trial made me fall in love and sleep a thousand times better.

However, I believe that the price at which we are being asked to pay is far too exclusive to a certain amount of people.

I am a high-school student graduating in May and I don??t have the money to pay for this app when all I??m trying to do is get educated and sleep good. I have stress coming from all angles and I have suffered from too many sleepless nights over the years and I just wish I could use this app a little more freely. Not full full access to 100% of commodities within the app, but a little more than we get now.  

When I first downloaded this app, I began to sleep amazingly. This was when I had full access during my free trial, but since it ended I have only been able to listen to ??Blue Gold? by Steven Fry. 

What a fantastic piece it is, but simply making the free version a bit more fair would be nice. 

Possibly allowing ??Blue Gold? to remain a permanent free story, but allowing other stories to circulate at random every 24 hours.

I would honestly love that. Even if I was unable to choose which sleep story to listen to, at least I would get something different everyday, y??know?

In short I think making this app so heavily subscription based really isn??t fair to the people who are just looking for better, healthier, safer options for sleeping outside of medicine. 

The app is supposed to help people sleep better(among other aspects of life), so how can they do that if they don??t have the money to pay for it. 

This app is a straight jacket. Point blank. You either have the money and buy the subscription or you listen to ?Blue Gold? a  hundred thousand freaking times to the point where you know the story word for word.

Know, I understand that the narrators and authors must be paid somehow, but it just doesn??t seem very fair to make this app so exclusive to only the people who can pay the already outrageous price for it.

It??s unfortunate that my review will be overshadowed by the majority of 5 star reviews because the price is not a problem for them.

My therapist suggested that instead of going back to school I should just take a spa day instead.  It was so patronizing, as though all women just need to spend time pampering to feel complete.

Without warning, without indication she was taking time away, my therapist stopped responding to messages, there was no formal termination of care, and I haven??t been able to get ahold of her for 3 months now. I can see that she has ??read? texts I??ve sent, but they go unanswered. She literally just ghosted on me. I am mentally vulnerable and was dealing with a lot during the Covid pandemic, self isolating for over 400 days due to being high risk. Talkspace doesn??t provide you with any sort of recourse for a situation like this. To make matters worse, there are apparently ??no records? covering my care from my therapist, so if I wanted to change providers (inside OR outside of talkspace), I??m going to have to start from literally ground zero. Over 2 years of therapy on talkspace is over $5,000 worth of time that I have spent working on many topics with my therapist, and talkspace is not doing much to help me get my records (which are legally my property). This company treats mental health patients as if they are using a service like Uber. They don??t hold themselves accountable when things go wrong. I??m constantly told how my ??concerns are being escalated? but nothing changes. Now, after being abandoned by a provider I trusted and worked with for 2 YEARS, I am afraid to trust another provider. It will take me months, if not years to recover from the trauma of being abandoned by my therapist when I really needed her. Talkspace offers me no solutions of how I can get my records or what I can do. There??s no consequence for the abandonment and I had to fight to get money back for the weeks I went without therapy. 
I??m disappointed?? the concept could??ve been great, but clearly there is no protection for patients being really hurt when a therapist on talkspace fails to uphold their professional duty and obligations.

This is what the app IS: A place where you can vent. If you don't have journal at home or a journal-like space on your computer and you would prefer if that journal occasionally talked back, this is for you. If you feel like you can't talk to friends/family about something in your life, this is for you. It's an app for lonely people to feel less alone. It's a place to air your thoughts. It's a place where someone will ""listen"" to you and tell you sympathetic things. (Examples: had a breakup, pet died, moved to a new city, fighting with a roommate, don't like your school or teachers, considering a career change)  This is what the app is NOT: a place where you can find comprehensive, in depth therapy for serious/legitimate mental issues and pressing life concerns. If you are really struggling and you need to work with someone because there are problems that are consuming your life. DO NOT BE TEMPTED BY THE FACT THAT YOU CAN ACCESS THIS ""THERAPY"" FROM ANYWHERE INCLUDING HOME; PUSH YOURSELF TO SEE A *PSYCHOLOGIST* OR A *PSYCHIATRIST* IN PERSON!

(Examples: depression, dealing with the death if a loved one, self-esteem issues, anger issues, bi-polar disorder, suicidal thoughts, phobias, divorce, addiction, etc.)  My experience is that this appears to be a part time job for the therapist/counselor. You're a second thought despite the price. I tend to hate leaving my house so I thought this app was for me. Considering the severity of my symptoms, filling out charts and being sent photocopied suggestions was not what was going to help.   I think we really, truly need to reassess what we consider to be counseling and what we consider to be therapy before applying that label to various services.

When I first got Calm, it had a handful of features unlocked. A few stories, several music/soundscape options. They were great. The premium options were tempting. I was considering buying the premium service though it was hard to justify it considering the plethora of other services available out there. Was Calm better than alternatives? Arguably, yes. Is it that much better to justify the high cost of admission? That was something I was on the fence about. I was willing to give it more time and see. In the meantime, I sung its praises it to a room full of women during a discussion on self-care, meditation, and stress management. I was a fan.  

Now, however, I find that everything on the app is now locked down and only available with the Premium subscription. I no longer have any options left making it worth the storage space on my phone. Where once the Premium subscription was tempting, it is now just off-putting. Apps that have no usability without subscription are immediately deleted on my phone. I gave Calm a little more time out of loyalty for a product I once loved. I??m not angry. I??m not trying to say that you shouldn??t have a premium service option.

Why can??t you get grants or donations instead of telling people they have to pay to live when they are at their worst? 

Ask for some of the INSANE amount of tax payer money wasted on weapons of war? No? 

Just going to continue to glorify BROKEN money?

Money means nothing without people. :/ :/ :/

I hate money.

Plenty of cultures are happy without money - $$$ doesn??t actually need to exist.

Why can??t the part of the app to be paid for be the interaction with doctors?

Poor people or those having trouble with insurance just supposed to suffer more?

The doctor that created insulin sold the patent for 1$ because ??it is unethical to profit off of saving lives.? 

Some doctors still today take whatever compensation people can give because they also think it is unethical to profit off saving lives.

Many parts of the app are pay only or insurance. Medical insurance is so broken and messed up that often makes me think they want me to die. 

Some parts that are paid only aren??t clear - don??t show desperate people what they can??t have is more humane.

Seeing posts of other users being happy is more depressing when depressed.

It doesn??t help to tell someone that doesn??t have friends or family?? to talk to friends or family. Some friends or family are what people need to get away from.

Many of the things the user has to reply ??Yep? to are too generic and it wouldn??t hurt to have another button or just do ??next? and not have the user confused with something that they don??t actually agree with.

The ??helps? or ??doesn??t help? needs an unsure option.

 The one in which focused on thinking about positive memories very much was ??doesn??t help? it made me cry the entire time because I have no positive memories that aren??t corrupted with pain.

Feel dumb for telling someone this app helped when only a few days in going to delete it already.

Came to this app because I have no other options right now. All the other apps were completely horrible or pay only.

And no, I don??t agree that all people can control their thoughts with willpower and practice alone.

Great to know I fall in all the mental traps ?? that aren??t based in reality.? :/ :/ :/

They did not give me phone numbers, or offer to help. They simply abandoned me with a bill telling me to go else where.

I??m sure they had reasons, legal an other reasons they are asked to tell high risk patients this. I find this hugely unethical knowing how difficult it is for those struggling to ask for health, to leave them worse off then they came.

Under no circumstance would I ever recommend Sanvello for this reason.

However, I think it??s just spin the therapist wheel and see who comes out b/c I clearly said I preferred a female therapist and lo and behold one of my options was a man. 

So I chose one of the women whose brief bio seemed to match my needs. They prompted me to set up a 10-min Zoom-like appointment. I also shared some details via the online portal. A day later, the therapist wrote back to say she wasn??t taking new clients. See how random that therapist wheel really is??

I reached out to T/S support. More than 2 weeks later I hadn??t received any response! I reached out again (even though they warn against sending a second reply because it will DELAY a response). Still nothing.

I Should Have Canceled Right Away. Life happens. For me it was medical leave and loss of job. This wasn??t on my mind. 

A year later, I look at my subscriptions for another reason, and am mortified to see Calm is set to renew that day! Tried to cancel immediately. It did cancel ?? for next year. The payment hadn??t even gone through yet. It was pending. But iTunes wasn??t letting go.

Tried to request a refund. ITunes said i was SOL, it didn??t meet the requirements for a refund and gave me a link to terms and conditions for subscriptions. I read it. There??s nothing in there about refunds for accidental renewals positive or negative. 

But evidently, in practice there is NO GRACE PERIOD for accidental renewals. 

This is not rocket science. ITunes can easily grant a grace period and refund. Other companies of reputation, integrity and good customer service do that. My daughter got a refund promptly from Master Class after she realized she got charged for a yearly subscription renewal 2 days after the charge went through. But iTunes refused to refund a renewal that was caught on the same day. 

So I??m charged another $63 for an app I didn??t even like that much and barely used and likely will not use again.

 I tried 2 therapists. I took their surveys and they confirmed my prior diagnosis and labeled it severe.

Me: So what can I do to work on this? (After no talk for 3 1/2 days)

643,1,"After three days of technical difficulty getting situated in a room, my partner and I began couple's therapy. It started out alright but after having a couple of exchanges working on communication, I noticed that our therapist didn't seem personally involved with us. It felt like she took one theme out of three or four messages we would send, and then just give us a textbook explanation of something we mentioned. Since we have both had personal counseling before, this felt highly unnecessary. I opted to switch therapists the last week of December.
This was apparently a huge mistake, because nobody was worth working through the holiday. We had to wait two days to get matched with a new person and she was on vacation and didn't respond much. The whole last week of the month was spent waiting to be matched and then going through the same process as we did at the beginning even though we gave the therapist access to our previous session. We got nothing out of the new therapist before our month subscription was over.

The app itself was full of bugs. I downloaded it the same day I paid for couple's therapy and didn't receive new messages in the app so I had to log onto the desktop version. Then it took two entire days to add my partner to the session because they couldn't figure out how to include him in the room if he already had the app on his phone. This caused me to be anxious that I was paying for time and couldn't just the service because they did didn't make it a priority to fix the problem so that we could start counseling right away. I constantly received a notification to download the newest version to see my messages in the app even though I had just downloaded it and no updates were available in the app store. Links and buttons froze or didn't work at all and scrolling down frequently caused visual glitches.

Overall, I paid for a month of therapy but really only got about 18 days' worth, which amounted to the work we could have accomplished in a single face-to-face session. I thought it would be convenient but having to wait an entire day for a reply even though the therapist is listed as available made me feel disengaged in the work we sought to accomplish. I feel robbed and I encourage anybody who needs help with mental health to stay away from this so-called service.",1/3/2019 15:38,talkspace,apple,maybe-privacy,yes

I called customer service and they took down my information and have yet to call me back. 

When this service worked, it was amazing. I really connect with my therapist. But over the last several days the app has crashed and then doesn't let me log in again for 2 hours! Now both my therapist and I have to wait to see when we can reschedule our face to face - if I keep this particular service that long. 

All in all, I'm deeply disappointed that the customer service is so slow and that the password reset/account locking is such a PITA. For a company trying to help those in need of care, they're doing a pitiful job.",8/1/2017 18:27,talkspace,apple,maybe-privacy,yes

676,1,"The concept of the app is outstanding. The execution is extremely poor. Over $150 a month for two sentences of advice/questions from your therapists. They say one week on Talkspace is equal to one 50 minute in person session. I've switched to in person therapy and one week of Talkspace at best might equal 10 minutes of real therapy. I had a therapist who ""checked in"" twice per day and in the beginning were detailed and wrote fairly long responses. Then it changed to a sentence here or there. They don't require the therapists to do anything but write two responses a day no matter how short and meaningless they are. I sent several suggestions to their customer service department and they basically could care less. Really they should have refunded my money but more importantly listened to my suggestions, this app will be a thing of the past in a year or two. My recommendation is go to an in person real therapist or check out any other therapy app. The therapists don't truly care (I tried two different therapists) and the customer service team could care less about anything other than getting your money. In person therapy is WAY better and will help you more in the long run. These guys didn't listen to me and just want your money, if what I'm saying isn't true then why do they charge so much for so little? Require so little from the therapists? How do you spell ripoff?

I asked her to provide more of a thorough consultation before I decided to commit to a paid subscription and no questions were asked, only attempts to prove why she was asking me for my money. It was not until I expressed my issues with the company's approach to therapy, and admitted that I would share my concerns with others that she asked additional questions and offered assistance.

687,1,"First I would like to say that I have had amazing experiences with 1-on-1 therapy over the past 10 years, & I truly believe therapy has changed & possibly saved my life.

That said. I was recently in a situation where I was unable to afford in person therapy, so I thought I would try Talkspace. I spent 4 months on this app hoping I would find some support while I was going through some big life changes & serious depression. During this time, I was shuffled between 3 therapists, re-explaining my situation each time.

Over this time, it became clear to me that the therapists that sign up to participate in this app are trained to simply copy & paste random parts of your message & place them after the words ??I heard you say? & send you to-do lists pulled from some database (& could care less what you did with them. If you didn??t like one, they??d be happy to send you another one! God forbid they should actually help you with it). I really felt like I was either talking to a robot, or someone who was just trying to do the minimum to check off ??respond to talkspace messages? in order to receive whatever amount of coins they??re awarded by pressing send.

I really gave this service a chance because I truly wanted (& needed) it to work. Unfortunately it just made me more angry, embarrassed, & depressed. If you are thinking about therapy- please go see someone in person, who is really invested in your wellbeing. Therapists like this really do exist, & you deserve that kind of attention if you really want to overcome your mental struggles.

??Edit:
Yes, I did contact support multiple times throughout my time using this app, & the only ??help? they gave was instructions you could??ve figured out yourself by looking at the website. Oh and also I forgot to mention, your therapist just might decide to go on vacation at any time with barely any notice (happened to me), so suddenly out of nowhere, no matter your emotional state, you??re paying for no service. Sure, you could shift to another therapist, but talkspace should know that it can be traumatic to relive your experiences over & over to new people you??ve just met. SUDDENLY switching therapists is just not simple for a mentally struggling person- in fact it is distressing. Does this developer even know how depression & anxiety work?

739,1,"THIS COMPANY IS A SCAM. I requested for them to cancel my account on February 5th and asked if I could get a refund for the first months service (260 dollars) which I signed up for on February 1st. The one therapy provider who got in touch with me was a no show and sent me a total of two messages trying to schedule a time we could talk (she never showed up for the time we arranged). I requested another therapy provider who also never got in touch. So ultimately in February I was charged 260 dollars for NO THERAPEUTIC help whatsoever. 

Customer service cancelled my TICKET for customer service, where I asked that they cancel my account and if possible provide a refund. It??s now March 1st and I see another charge for 260 dollars. 

So they have altogether stolen 520 dollars for me. Not to mention, throughout my subscription I got ZERO THERAPEUTIC HELP. I was unable to talk to a SINGLE PERSON/THERAPIST. 

Do yourself a favor and find a real therapist through headway.co, which is ultimately what I ended up having to do. They can pair you with a provider who actually takes your insurance so that the charge is just for the copay.  My dad just died of COVID and I had to talk with someone, which this app fully never did.

926,1,"I struggle with an anxiety disorder and depression. I needed to start speaking with someone quickly and thought this would be a good way to do so while finding a local therapist for tele-visits. 

For the cost of the service I could have had three actual therapy sessions. I heard from the therapist after the time the app told me I would and they explained that they have no control over how many patients they have so they cannot even begin to meet the deadlines set in the app. We??re talking about 100 people being assigned to a single therapist. No one can be expected to provide quality therapy to that many clients. 

Did some more online research and found out that therapists are barely getting paid so why would there be any incentive for them to answer messages let alone provide meaningful responses? So yes, I could switch therapists, but then a person who has done nothing wrong but can??t keep up with Talkspace??s ridiculous client numbers gets penalized and I would just get shifted to another therapist in the same boat. It??s not right for either of us. 

I wish I??d researched them more before signing up but I was in need of help and short on time. Now they have my money, don??t offer refunds and I??m at square one and facing the same issues I signed up to get help managing on my own.  $300+ dollars has given me some generic exercises easily found in any CBT/DBT workbook and an expensive digital journal and no actual therapy. 

I feel cheated out of my therapy budget for the month and will not continue with the service. If you are struggling with any diagnosed condition this is not a good place to seek assistance. While they claim that it??s less expensive than traditional therapy, it??s not and the value for the money is low for both patients and therapists.

After using the app for 3 days, I feel kind of disappointed in the therapist matching process. I was first connected to a therapist that asked me what I was looking for and then after rambling a bunch told me I needed to pay. Okay whatever, I paid, then she gave me a questionnaire that asked me be same info I just rambles about. I type out the answers to the questionnaire in a more structured format and I send it to her. She says she'll use it to match me to a therapist. A day later I get connected to a therapist I was excited to talk about my problems. She asks me how I'm feeling and what's been bothering me. I type out a bunch of stuff about my personal life and what I'm going through. A few hours later she responds and doesn't even address what I said other than that I can type as much as I want. And then she hits me with all this formal consent stuff and scheduling and how the platform works. Lady, why didn't you get this legal stuff over with before you asked me how I was? Also why would you say I can type as much as I want if you aren't even going to address what I have said? She didn't even introduce herself or say where she was from or explain her professional background. There is no conversation.

1079,1,"To start this off I really never leave reviews for anything unless I feel like it??s really a major issue that people beware of - It??s actually irresponsible this app is allowed to operate. Please avoid using this app if you need reliable help and here is why:

I??ve done in person therapy pre-pandemic so I know what it??s supposed to be like. Because of the pandemic I decided to give virtual therapy a try with Talkspace. The first issue is there were slim picking for providers - which is strange to me since it??s a virtual service it??s not like the provider has to be in your city, but this is minor. When I did finally land on a provider it was fine at first but then he very quickly became unreliable - which was the second issue. Some people opt to message throughout the week - I opt for the 60 minute session once a week. The provider was egregiously late on more than one occasion or would simply cancel at the last minute - which they charge you for anyways even if the cancellation is on the provider end. 

The third issue is there often seems to be glitches with the app itself or providers are not adequately trained in the interface or with the technology. There were several instances where I wanted to book another session with the provider and he simply wasn??t doing the after session wrap-up on his end to allow the app to provider another available session to book. I had to remind him of this several times until I eventually got tired of having to do this. There were several weeks where I would have booked sessions where I simply wasn??t able to do it was a very haphazard schedule. The fourth issue here is you are completely at the mercy of the providers schedule. They can either forget to allow you to book, or cancel a session at will with no consequences. In regular therapy this could also be an issue but when I had an in person therapist they almost never cancelled and were much more cognizant of my time and keeping a regular treatment schedule.

Once I realized this was actually mentally exhausting me I decided to switch providers to see if that would alleviate. The second provider was a no-show on the intro session. So clearly Talkspace isn??t really vetting providers well and definitely aren??t monitoring their service in any meaningful way. Which brings me to the final issue - there is no customer service number. Big red flag for any service. You cannot call and speak to a representation you have to submit a ticket with your complaint and wait for a response. This could take anywhere from a week to a month or more and from my experience it??s more on the longer side. I did it once and realized it was futile. 

In conclusion this app is terrible for your mental health actually. I wouldn??t recommend it to anyone seeking reliable mental help especially if you??re desperate it would most likely push you over the edge. Not sure how the psych board lets this kind of malpractice fly - mental health is a serious thing.",12/1/2020 1:51,talkspace,apple,maybe-privacy,yes

1108,1,"Warning: The Talkspace  format can cause more anxiety than traditional therapy.

Tl;DR Use Talkspace if you want to be matched with a therapist who won??t be able to meet the basic needs of your subscription type. Use Talkspace if you like terrible customer service. Use Talkspace if you want to pay upfront for a service that you cannot get a refund if unsatisfied in the first week. 

I have been doing traditional in-person therapy. I was willing to try Talkspace as an alternative to regular therapy. In hindsight, I wish I read some of the terrible reviews to prevent my Talkspace-induced anxiety.

***Matching with a therapist***

I paid upfront for three months of Talkspace including 4 video sessions a month. 

I was matched with a therapist who could only see me on video once a month and only on specific days.

However the therapist did not disclose this upfront. The therapist only admitted the lack of availability after I had been matched for a week and had asked multiple days in a row to schedule our video session and I had reached out to customer support.

***The format***

Unlike traditional in-person therapy that can contain feelings in a specific time/place.

??Therapy? on Talkspace feels like a slow-boat of anxiety. The therapist will at most reply 2 times a day to possibly not the most relevant part of whatever you wrote.  

Intake involves going through a lot of sensitive and challenging parts of personal history. Dredging up lots of yucky feelings without a proper therapy container to help process. In a week, I hadn??t even finished the intake process. 

***Customer service***

I have been shocked how terrible the customer support is for an app targeting a vulnerable population of people seeking mental health therapy.

The response time is slow, if they respond at all.

After having a terrible first week with a therapist, I tried to cancel and get a refund. They wouldn??t.

It didn??t matter that their algorithm (purposely?) had matched me to a therapist who could not meet the needs of what I paid for upfront.

Buried in the Terms of Service, which companies know people generally don??t completely read, they will not refund for any upfront paid subscription.

It doesn??t matter if you had high hopes for using Talkspace for 3 months or more, but had a terrible first week experience with the app.

Thus, I paid over a thousand dollars for a week of the absolutely worst therapy of my life. 

I wouldn??t be surprised if the Talkspace App is intentionally deceptive for profits instead of providing quality therapeutic service.",9/26/2019 11:41,talkspace,apple,maybe-privacy,yes

1125,1,"A good concept but a disappointing experience.

First, it is very misleading when it says 24/7 chat. Some sort of chat therapy would be a really great thing to have, but that is not talkspace. They should openly say that you will only get one message a day from your provider 5 days a week. This is not what I expected.

The first week is all just about setting up your therapy, and with one message a day and multiple forms to get through, this goes at a snail's pace. It feels as though the therapist are trained to drag out the set up period for as long as possible. So the first week is essentially wasted, but you are still charged for it.

 The other thing which seems unethical about this app is it constantly threatens you that you'll lose your therapist and never be able to pick them again. I feel that if this were a legitimate mental health app and you could not afford a therapist for a couple of months that you should be able to get back your old therapist no matter how much time has gone by. Your issues are personal and therapy is meant to build on your relationship with a therapist.  

*Edit* To their credit the support team did refund me which I am very grateful for. 

I found my therapist online which seemed like he had his own practice, but when I messaged him saying that the Talkspace format was not going to work out for me and that I wanted regular therapy sessions, he said he was sorry and that he could only offer therapy through Talkspace.

1157,1,"Very unhappy.

I signed up for this month with the maximum plan and paid for the four live sessions that go with it. I hadn??t used the sessions and decided that I should change my subscription for NEXT month to the middle tier subscription with only one live session so that I didn??t forget and stay on the same plan for next month. 

When I did that, it charged me ANOTHER full month and took away my 4 live sessions for this month that I already paid for. I contacted you guys and Instead of fully refunding me, you charged me an extra $58 and then....credited it to me for next month? I would like my money REFUNDED please-doesn??t everyone?, as right now I??m not sure I want to continue on this app for a myriad of reasons. 

There have been so many issues with the app this month, both for my therapist and I-have had messages and voice messages get deleted or not send, I get thrown off the app constantly when I type up an essay of important thoughts and then lose it, AND it??s been making it impossible for me to schedule a live session with my therapist making the ease of use for this app go out the window completely and be replaced with utter frustration. 

Yesterday we tried doing the FIRST Skype live session one of this month and it failed in two ways-it showed to her that I had ZERO live sessions left (when I should have 4) so she didn??t get paid, and THEN while I was mid sentence and crying and going into a heavy topic, the app started freezing and my therapist and I were kicked off and she wasn??t even able to send me a voice message after and I was left in a really bad state that exacerbated my mental health. 

I??m EXTREMELY unhappy and I love my therapist but your app/interface/contact system is making me want to leave ASAP, but the fact that I haven??t gotten/can??t get what I ALREADY paid for is what??s making me most irate. This isn??t ok. You advertise that I can always get in touch, but I??ve had nothing but problems for almost 2 weeks. What??s going on? This is a blatant joke and for the amount of money I??m paying and the fact this is a MENTAL health service, you??d think you??d want to have a useable interface that isn??t bugged with issues, allow customers and therapists to communicate, not overcharge people, and actually refund instead of crediting because I don??t know if I want to stay with you guys!

I reported a sleep story where elephants are made to work, taking tourists around on a safari, even though the story claims they did them a favor by not riding on them (!) but mind you, still made to work for tourists and taken away from the wild and their families and herd to be our guides!

This is just promoting exploitation of wild animals, which are already having enough issues in their struggle to survive! If not curbed, who knows they might have a animal circus story next! 

This is horrendous for a wellness app or anywhere! Inspite of reporting, they didn??t even bother to take such content down and the ??customer support? was condescending in his tone when followed up to enquire what action has been taken!! 

Will definitely be taking this up further with animal rights organizations as they haven??t removed that content!

And a half hour is not even enough to start talking with somebody. It??s a joke it??s a waste it??s nothing it??s meaningless. I have sent video messages that never sent or ones that sent without the audio. I tried to sign a friend up for Talkspace only to find that for some reason they never even got the triage therapist. So nobody ever help them get started and we can??t figure out why they were never able to move forward at all. The therapist on here are great however it??s just going to end and heartbreak when you realize that your communication goes nowhere after you pour out your heart and it turns out to be a video of you not even talking just moving your mouth. And trying to contact customer service goes nowhere. I tried contacting them months ago and I??ve given up.

Addition: I recently did try to contact again. The first thing they asked me was if I was trying to fire my therapist as opposed to quitting the service as a whole. I again explained in detail all of the things I??ve dealt with above and the person completely misunderstood and asked me if I tried the online content as well as the app which I have and they are both awful. So even when I did get support it was awful and it took an additional day to get them to send me the confirmation that my card would not be charged ever again. The initial support was also long long after I had requested contact in the app. So don??t give me the quick turnaround time. You??re a developer or an engineer, do you actually work in the same building with your customer support? Because if you don??t work intimately with your support team you can never get this app to work well.

They say you can video message your therapist, but the maximum video length is 5 minutes, so if you??re right in the middle of a delicate explanation and time runs out, you??re interrupted.

Update : this service is terrible, the therapist just ask a bunch of questions and doesn??t give you any insight or tips to improve the situation . I finished the twelve weeks and the therapist just mentioned that my paid sessions were almost up , asked me two more questions , I replied and after that nothing else was said . The therapist didn??t even read the message .... you would think that if my time was almost up , there would be some type of closure /final suggestion to improve what led me to seek therapy . You are just going to be left in the air even though the therapist knows that your time in almost up and he/she needs to wrap it off

There is no owner or no one and she has no way of contacting billing.  So when they take ur money you are screwed! Waiting still!,4/6/2016 10:46,talkspace,google,maybe-privacy,yes

I was sent the same paperwork twice and felt I didn??t matter enough. I wanted to talk to someone which was the whole idea I needed for therapy. I was excited for the chance but I am not communicated to enough to make it worth it. I think the therapists workload must be high because I did not seem important more often than not. I told the therapist about 4 weeks ago I was done. Cancelled the subscription and today get charged again $260. Very disappointing.  Stupid money sucking app. Very annoying and frustrated.  I want my money back. This is a little ridiculous.  I will try another therapy option. This is not it. I am a huge advocate for therapy too and I??m so disappointed.

1446,1,"I loved the idea of Talkspace but I was a bit apprehensive as I was reading the reviews. Many people said they never heard back from their therapist and had to find a new one multiple times.  I eventually decided to download it but unfortunately, my experience was exactly the same. I haven??t heard from my therapist and it??s been well over a week since when I??ve initially contacted her the first time. I??ve done in person therapy and I thought I??d be a great candidate for TalkSpace. It??s ridiculous that you pay upfront for these services when a response back from a therapist isn??t even guaranteed. With the money I already paid for the month, I could have had 2 in-person one hour sessions (and I would pay AFTER these services were provided). I??m holding this platform to a higher standard because you all are offering therapy services to people who are requesting help. It??s really unfortunate that more often than not, people aren??t hearing back from their therapists. I??m not even going to try to find another therapist because I don??t want to waste another week of my time retaking the questionnaire/matching with a new therapist/ waiting for their response. It??s unfair to expect users to wait 2-3 weeks of their first month just waiting for a first response from anyone.
